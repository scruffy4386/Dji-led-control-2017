Presentation.

This project was designed to improve visibility from all angles , because the original LED does not allow a good view at all times.

There are two animations also possible in flight.

This is done with rings led's Neopixel (4 ring 16 addressable LED 's ) and an Arduino module, the choice of the Arduino is free, it is necessary to respect the inputs and outputs or edit the code.

Operation.

At rest , at ground , motor OFF, less than 1000ms Gas (servo signal), the status of LED 's rings is identical to that of the original led Dji Naza V2.

Over 1000ms , when arming the motors starts , animation rings led's start.

There are two animations, if you use an additional channel to make this selection .

The first, by default or with a signal less than 1500ms is a rotating animation, it's a copy of direction of motors M1 , M2 , M3 and M4 . Attention to the order of assembly.
The speed of animation ,varies with throttle .

The other animation is active with a greater than 1500 ms signal, is a fading , the brightness varies from a minimum to a maximum and back again. The fading speed also varies with throttle .

In both cases animation flying color status LED original is respected, but any more flashing sequences, because  there are animations.

For the identification of colors , refer to the instruction manual of Dji Naza V2.

The comments in the code helps you  to make your changes , speeds, colors animations for example .

If editing, programming is not your cup of tea, contact me, I will prepare a kit ready for use in January 2014.
